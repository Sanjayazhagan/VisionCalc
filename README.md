# VisionCalc
VisionCalc is a web application that allows users to draw mathematical expressions containing numbers (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and square brackets ([, ]). The system then processes the drawing using machine learning (CNN-based model) to recognize the characters, converts them into a valid mathematical expression, and evaluates the result.
